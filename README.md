[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kunerd/jpaillier.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kunerd/jpaillier)

A Java implementation of the Paillier cryptosystem.

This library was developed as part of the research project CoPPDA (Corporate Privacy Preserving Data Analysis, http://www.enterprise-application-development.org/projects/coppda.html). To see it in action have a look at [ppid3](https://github.com/kunerd/ppid3) where it is used to implement a privacy preserving ID3 decision tree generation algorithm.

**WARNING: This library was developed for research only and is by no means implemented in a cryptographically secure way.**

Also this library contains a prototype of SECGENCLOUD where it can perform secure computation on genomic data in cloud. The code is in the IndexBuild directory where the driver functions run the functionality.
